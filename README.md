Toice - MP3 Trim and Save 
I thanks developers of following Libraries for their work;
    1. Lame.js
    2. Wavesurfer.js
    
 Special points to focus on: 
  1. Worker can now work on localHost.
  2. Fuction to construct MP3 file from WAV file
  3. Download Button can lead to multiple files.
  4. Downloaded files must be generated as Output.mp3

This is an execution project that is performed while learning.
This project consists of Encoding, Decoding, Transcoding, working with Blob and changing blob attributes.
